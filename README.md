# Counting-Sheep-Bot
My personal open source discord bot :3 I'm coding it from the ground up- so it's not feature rich by any means.

plugins.py is for python functions that do not require the discord api to run, commands.py is the main meat of the bot, and testing.py is the code i wrote before i scrapped it and rewrote it from the ground up. I didn't want to include testing.py but I felt like I couldn't delete it so here we are.
